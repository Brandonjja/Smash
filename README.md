# Smash

Super Smash PvP is a Minecraft gamemode inspired by Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. The aim of the game is to knock your opponents off the map to gain points, using your special kit items, as well as items (powerups) picked up around the map. The more damage you recieve, the more knockback you recieve on each hit.
