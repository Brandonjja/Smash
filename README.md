# Smash

Super Smash PvP is a Minecraft gamemode inspired by Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. The goal of the game is to knock your oponents off the map using your special kit items, as well as items (powerups) picked up around the map. The more damage you recieve, the more knockback you recieve on each hit.
